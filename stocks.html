        <h2>Understanding Stocks</h2>
        <p>Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you purchase a small piece of that company,
          which means you have a claim on its assets and earnings. Stocks are bought and sold on stock exchanges, like
          the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India.</p>

        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Buying stocks means you own a part of the company. If the company does well,
            your stocks may increase in value.</li>
          <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> Some companies share their profits with shareholders by paying dividends,
            which are regular cash payments made to stockholders.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Value:</strong> The price of stocks fluctuates based on supply and demand in the market.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Long-term Investment:</strong> Many investors buy stocks expecting the company to grow over time.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Investing in stocks comes with risks, as stock prices can be volatile.</li>
          <li><strong>Stock Market:</strong> The stock market is where stocks are bought and sold through brokers or
            online platforms.</li>
